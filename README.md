- Analyze job descriptions and compare with resumes.
- Generate a match score based on skills, experience, and keywords.
- Highlight missing skills or areas of improvement for candidates.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **NLTK / spaCy** – Natural Language Processing for text analysis
- **pandas** – Data handling and processing
- **scikit-learn** – Machine learning algorithms for scoring
- **Python-docx / PyPDF2** – Resume parsing

## How it Works
